# Total-Apocalypse

This is a revitalization of a seemingly dead project [**The Apocalypse Project**](https://forum.cfx.re/t/the-apocalypse-project-final-version-updated-20-12-2021/1178682), since that project seems dead and not worked on anymore our team has picked it back up so that it can get fixed up and working again. We have already made a lot of changes and fixes.

 - Reconfigured some maps to feel more in place with the others and enviorments around them.
 - Removed any conflicting spawns and maps.
 - Fixed holes in the maps and missing roads.
 - Added a few more locations and minor improvements to some that are already in place.
